Question 1,
what is a variable?
A data container where the data can change during program execution

2. What is a constant?
It's a data container where the value cannot be altereed after is has been declared

3. In the following example - what's the variable and what's the data of the variable?

let userAge = 30;

userAge is the variable, 30 is the data

4. Could you replace this snippet

let age = 30;
alert(age);
with this one

alert(30);
and still get the same result?
yes

5. Question 5:
Why do we need variables if

let age = 30;
alert(age);
can be re-written as

alert(30);
?
(In general, not just in this snippet)

Variables can store data  that may change during program exeution. So hard-coding (as in the second snippet) isn't always an option. Additionally, the same value might be needed in multiple places. Using a variable allows you to refer to that variable and only change the value in one place(=> the variable) instead of multiple places in  code.

6. Which kind of operator is the = operator?

it's an assignment operator used to asign values
